# React Native Course Notes üìù

## Setup üõ†Ô∏è

Create new app using expo:
`npx create-expo-app 'app-name' -t`
-t will show options to choose (blank typescript)

Install Dependencies:
`npm expo lint`
`npx expo install -- --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`

Run the app on phone
download expo go then run `npx run start` it will start the JavaScript bundler
open the camera app and scan the QR code to deep link to Expo Go.

## React Native Basics

- View is used almost exactly to how a `div` is used on the web: for positioning and styling.
- All text must be surround by a `<Text>` tag
- All styling in React Native is using flexbox, it's similar to the web, but some defaults are different

### Inline Styles

- No units (no px, em, or rem, everything is in display points)
- Defined as valid JavaScript objetcs
  - `backgroundColor` instead of `background-color`
- No css animations
- Positioning in React Native is done with Flexbox, few differences from the web:

  - all elements have `display: flex` by default
  - `flexDirection` defaults to `column` (instead of `row`)
  - `alignContent` defaults to `flex-start` (instead of `strech`)
  - `flexShrink` defaults to `0` (instead of `1`)
  - the `flex` parameter only supports a single number
  - cannot have global styles in React Native, an easy way to share styles between components is have a shared theme file

### Button

In order to make anything into a button, wrap it in a Pressable or Touchable component. The two main components you use here are `TouchableOpacity`, and `Pressable`.

### Icons

Expo icons is built on top of react-native-vector-icons and have a convenient website to search for icons https://icons.expo.fyi/Index.

To install: `npx expo install @expo/vector-icons`

SVGs are not the most optimal way to render things on react native (in particular Android).

### Navigation

React Native doesn't come with a navigation library built in, so need to use external library to handle this.
Expo Router is a file system-based navigation for React Native, and it's built on top of React Navigation.
The filename-to-URL mapping is more obvious on the web. Making it work for mobile has some additional difficulties because we have different types of navigation patterns:

- Stack
  - displaying screens in Stack is the default way to navigate. It means that when you navigate to a new screen, it's rendered on top of the current screen.
- Modal
  - rendering a screen as a Modal, means rendering it on top of the other content. It's important to note that in order for this to work, the modal screen must be defined above or adjacent to the other screens it's being rendered on top of. So for example you couldn't render a screen within a tab navigator modally over the navigator.
- Tabs --> Bottom tab navigation
  - the bottom tab navigaion means rendering the screens (or stacks of screens) as bottom tabs where the tabs are always visible so you can easily switch between them.

The key is to making it work is `_layout` routes.
Each folder may have exactly one layout route and it will dictate how the files in the route get laid out.

To install: `npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar`

Change the main entry in `package.json` to `"main": "expo-router/entry"`
Modify `app.json` to add a sheme: { "sheme": "app-name" }
--> the reason this is required is that Expo Router comes with deep linking built in
(deep linking is basically creating a URL that opens your app to a specific screen)
--> the way deep linking works on mobile is that your mobile app registers to listen to a specific scheme

#### Ways to navigate

There are 3 main ways to navigate between screens:

Using the `Link` component
Programmatically with the `useRouter` hook
Using the built-in header and bottom tabs button

#### Nested navigators

You can nest navigators pretty much infinitely: a stack within a stack, a stack within a tab, a tab within a stack within a screen.

### TextInput

Unlike the on the web, there is no form component in React Native, the inputs are all handled individually.

The input used to receive text from the user's keyboard ia a TextInput, that is used for both text and numerical inputs.
The keyboard will appear automatically when the text input is focused, but we can also close and open it programmatically.

The type of keyboard shown is actually determined by a prop on the TextInput: e.g. setting the keyboardType to phone-pad opens a keyboard that's laid out for entering phone numbers.

The closest equivalent to onSubmit on forms is the onSubmitEditing callback. Fired when the user presses the "return" key on their keyboard which in turn can be customized with the returnKeyType prop.

### ScrollView

Unlike the web, Views in native don't scroll by default. Even if we add so many items they're longer than the screen, they will just disappear off the screen. To make a page scrollable, we need to use a different component: a ScrollView.

### FlatList

ScrollViews are definitely handy for displaying long content, but if you're ever in a position where you:

1. have an array of items you need to map over to render
2. are rendering a full screen list

Then you should be using a FlatList. Not only is it more feature-rich, with built-in pull-to-refresh, scroll-to-index, header and footer support, the most important feature is that it is optimized for rendering large lists. In particular it does not render the components that are nowhere near being seen on your screen.

### Data Persistance

We need to store the shopping list in the device's storage.

For this, we'll be using AsyncStorage - an unencrypted key-value store for React Native. It's very similar to localStorage on the web, but the calls to is are asynchronous.

To install: `npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage`

Whenever we have to JSON parse everything, we have to make sure to do a try-catch in React Native, because otherwise, thing might crash if the things that we're passing are not a valid JSON object.

### Layout Animation

Create custom animation with React Native, there are 2 libraries for that:
* React Native Reanimated: https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/
* React Native Gesture Handler: https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/

### Haptics

Haptic feedback is the little vibration your phone makes in response to certain actions. Using it in the right place at the right time improves the experience of using your app. The expo-haptics library has several built-in types of vibration from light to heavy.

To install: `npx expo install expo-haptics`

### Push Notifications

A push notification is an alert generated by an application when the application is not open. For mobile apps there are two types of notifications:

* remote notifications are sent to the device from a server using the device push token
* local notifications are scheduled from within the app and send to the current device only

#### Ask for Permission

‚ö†Ô∏è You can only ask once!
Note that you can only ask for push permission once. Further calls to requestPermissionsAsync will not do anything. If you accidentally reject push notification permission, you'll have to uninstall and re-install the app to get prompted again. Alternatively go to Settings -> Notifications -> Expo Go and manually toggle on the Notifications permission.

### Useful Commands

--> restart the bundler: `npx expo start --reset-cache`

### Notes

`useEffect(() => {}, []);` --> common to use this to fetch some initial data, use effects are synchronous we can't do anything asynchrounous in them
use case: `AsyncStorage` is asynchrounous, so to execute an async function from a sync `useEffect` the common workaround is define an async function
inside the `useEffect`
